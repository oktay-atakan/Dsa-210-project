# The Impact of Game Soundtracks on Player Reception

Project Overview
-----------------------------------------------------
This project explores whether there is an impact of a game soundtrack on player reception. Using the data of game reviews and comparing them with "Great Soundtrack" tags, popularity of the soundtrack, and nominations or awards of that game in soundtrack-related categories; the difference between reviews of the games with great and popular soundtracks and the games without them will be analyzed.

While working on a game, companies always use large amount of resources for their game soundtracks. For instance, Valve had a 'Valve Studio Orchestra' for their soundtracks, and the programmer of a game named 'Doki Doki: Literature Club' was originally a composer and wrote a story where he could use the elements of the soundtrack efficiently. Therefore, understanding whether there is an effect of a game soundtrack on the market of the game is essential in the high-paying game industry.

The primary goal of this project is to understand if there is a relationship between great and popular soundtracks and the percentage of positive game reviews. Since the video game industry is a wide-range and high-priced industry, it is important to understand whether it is worth the money and effort that is put into the soundtrack of a game.

Motivation
-----------------------------------------------------
As a musician, I've always been interested in game soundtracks. I like listening to them, playing them myself with my instrument, and trying to compose soundtracks that can be used in games. Therefore, this is a topic that I am interested in personally. Because I am interested in game soundtracks, I have developed scientific curiosity about their effects too. Since I like to compose game soundtracks, I am curious about how they, or if they, make a difference in a game.

Research question
-----------------------------------------------------
Does the visibility or quality of a video game soundtrack have an influence on player reception?

Sub-questions:

Do games with the “Great Soundtrack” tag on Steam receive higher review scores than others?

Is there a relationship between original soundtrack visibility measured by YouTube view counts and game ratings?

Do award-winning or nominated soundtracks correlate with higher critical reception?

-----------------------------------------------------
Hypothesis
-----------------------------------------------------
The soundtrack of a video game affects player reception and has an impact on the game reviews and game ratings.
